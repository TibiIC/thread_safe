# thread_safe
Package I'm using during my PhD to run experiments concurrently. I find that python's community on thread-safe tools and data-structures is limited/non-existent, especially for finer grained concurrency. Hope this project to be one of many to limit duplications in projects trying to achieve high throughput.
